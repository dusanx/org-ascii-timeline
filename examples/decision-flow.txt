>= Backend Team
<= Frontend Team

>> Proposing GraphQL API
   instead of REST
   :architecture:

<? How does this affect caching?
   :performance:

   :solution:

<? What about team learning curve?
   :concern:

>> We can start with a pilot service
   Provide internal training sessions
   :approach:

<< Sounds reasonable
   Let's prototype with one endpoint
   :decision:
